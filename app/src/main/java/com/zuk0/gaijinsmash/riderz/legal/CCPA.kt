    //Mobile devices are endpoints under CCPA;

    //You must protect the 60 percent of your organizationâ€™s endpoints (mobile devices) as well as you already protect the 40 percent (personal computers and servers);
    //You need on-device, rather than cloud-based, protection to protect mobile devices;
    //Only machine learning-based technology can keep up with evolving threats; and
    //You must protect mobile devices against Device, Network, Application and Phishing attacks.
